# Homework 1

## Problem 1

Write a pretty printer for the arithmetic-expression language in
functional-style Scala. 

## Problem 2

Write an evaluator for the arithmetic-expression language in
object-oriented-style Scala.

## Problem 3

Extend the pretty printer and evaluator from Problem 1 and 2 respectively.
Note that you should not edit the source file containing the solutios for
Problem 1 and 2.  Instead, make a copy of them first.  Yes, that is the point.
