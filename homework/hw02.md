# Homework 2

## Problem 1

Implement `filter` using `fold` on `List[Int]`.

## Problem 2

Replace the `With` construct in the language `WAE` (the Arithmetic Expressions
extended with the `with`-expression) with `Letp` (parallel binding `let`) and
`Lets` (sequential binding `let*`), then define `eval` for this new language
with parallel and sequential local bindings.
