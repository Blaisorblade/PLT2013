# Homework 2

## Problem 1

Implement `filter` using `fold` on `List[Int]`.

## Problem 2

Extend the language `WAE` (as defined in the lecture) with a conditional
construct, known as an `if`-expression.

## Problem 3

Replace the `With` construct in the extended language from Problem 2, call it
`WABE`, with `Letp` (_a.k.a._ `let`) and `Lets` (_a.k.a._ `let*`), so that your
interpreter suppports parallel and sequential bindings.
