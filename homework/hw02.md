# Homework 2

## Problem 1

Implement `map` and `filter` using `fold` over `List[Int]`.

## Problem 2

Extend the language WAE (as defined in the lecture) with a conditional
construct, known as an `if`-expression.  Note that you need a way to represent
booleans.

## Problem 3

Replace the `With` construct in WAE with `Letp` (_a.k.a._
[`let`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/let.html?q=parallel%20binding#%28part._.Parallel_.Binding__let%29),
for parallel bindings) and `Lets` (_a.k.a._
[`let*`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/let.html?q=sequential%20binding&q=parallel%20binding#%28part._.Sequential_.Binding__let_%29),
for sequential bindngs), so that your interpreter suppports parallel and
sequential bindings.
