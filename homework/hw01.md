# Homework 1

## Problem 1

Write a pretty printer for the arithmetic-expression language (as defined in
the lecture) in functional-style Scala.  Note that your solution should handle
grouping of expressions inside parentheses correctly.

## Problem 2

Write an evaluator for the arithmetic-expression language (as defined in the
lecture) in object-oriented-style Scala.

## Problem 3

Extend the pretty printer and evaluator from Problem 1 and 2 respectively to
support a richer arithemetic-expression language with two more operators,
namely `-` (binary minus) and `/` (divides).  Note that you should not edit the
source file containing the solutios for Problem 1 and 2.  Instead, make a copy
of them first.  Yes, that is the point.  ;)
