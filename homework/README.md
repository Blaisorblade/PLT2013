Here are some rules for homework assignments of the first part of PLT lecture.

1. The homework is mandatory, meaning you _must_ submit your solutions, as an
   individual or a pair.  Remember, if you do not, you are _not_ allowed to
   attend the final exam.

2. Please send your source files to <pllecture@informatik.uni-marburg.de> or
   <pllecture@mathematik.uni-marburg.de> and follow the convention below to
   name your files:

    ```
    Hw<Homework Number>-Pr<Problem Number>-<Your Name>+<Your Parter's Name>.scala
    ```

    For example, if someone called Tim submits his solution for the first
    homework, his files should be named `Hw01-Pr01-Tim.scala` and so on; or if
    he does the homework together with another called Tom, their files should
    be named `Hw01-Pr01-Tim+Tom.scala` and so on.  For a pair, one submission
    is sufficient.  Please remember to include your parter's name.

3. Your solutions should be submited _before_ the end of every sunday.  Later
   submissions will not count.  _Only_ submissions before the end of Saturday
   will get feedback. 

4. If you can not fully solve a problem, please include your partial solution
   and describe what part is difficult for you, so that I know you have tried.
