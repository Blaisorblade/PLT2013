Here are some rules for homework assignments for the first part of the PLT
lecture.

1. The homework is mandatory, meaning you _must_ submit your solutions, as an
   individual or a pair.  Remember, if you do not, you are _not_ allowed to
   attend the final exam.

2. Please send your source files to <pllecture@informatik.uni-marburg.de> or
   <pllecture@mathematik.uni-marburg.de> and follow the convention below to
   name your files:

    ```
    PLT2013-Hw<Homework Number>-Pr<Problem Number>-<Your Name>+<Your Parter's Name>.scala
    ```

    For example, if someone called Sam submits his solutions for the first
    homework, his files should be named `PLT2013-Hw01-Pr01-Sam.scala` and so
    on; or if he does the homework together with another one called Tom, their
    files should be named `PLT2013-Hw01-Pr01-Sam+Tom.scala` and so on.  For a
    pair, one submission is sufficient.  Then please remember to include your
    parter's name.

3. Your solutions should be submitted _before_ the end of every Sunday.  Later
   submissions do not count.  _Only_ submissions before the end of Saturday
   will get feedback. 

4. In case you can not fully solve a problem, please include your partial
   solution and describe what part is difficult for you, so that I know you
   have tried.
